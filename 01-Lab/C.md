# c. Write a one page essay where you explain clearly why software architecture is important  #

Software architecture is like a blueprint or a map for a building. It shows how the parts of a program fit together and work. Without it, It would end up with a confusing mess.

Split a large program into smaller pieces. That makes it easier to understand and work on each piece.

Decide things like how different parts talk to each other. This keeps everyone on the same page.

Diagrams and simple notes let developers, managers, and other team members understand the plan.

Plan for things like speed, security, and reliability from the start, instead of fixing them later.
